<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Adeyemi Babalola. I am a web developer. I am passionate about being a web developer,<br>
creating and managing websites that can be easily accessible, user friendly, aesthetically pleasing.<br> 
I also have good experience in the customer service field, so I understand what a stress free-website<br>
means to clients. I love a good on-screen experience</p>

<p><h2>Personally</h2></p>
I like arts, drawing, painting ( which I am really bad at), I like good music, movies, I used to wonder<br> 
how we can stream anything online, this is also one of the I so much want to know how the website works.<br> 
I like travels, exploring different website, checking out the aesthetics. 

<p>Thank you for visiting this website, I look forward to working with you and sharing more information<br> 
with you. <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/ciao">Ciao</a></p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Adeyemi Babalola</p>
